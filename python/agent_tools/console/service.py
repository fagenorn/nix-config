"""The console's loopback service: the log-derived view and the desk page over HTTP.

The service binds `127.0.0.1` on one port (`DEFAULT_PORT`) and nothing else; no
parameter names a host. `Host` must be `127.0.0.1:<port>` or `localhost:<port>`
for the port actually bound, else the answer is `403` `text/plain`
`loopback only`.

Routes (every response carries `Cache-Control: no-store` and
`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, and every one but the stream `Content-Length`):

    GET /           200 text/html; charset=utf-8, the page, with `Content-Security-Policy: CSP`
    GET /api/state  200 application/json, the encoded view (see `view.py`)
    GET /api/stream 200 text/event-stream; charset=utf-8, the update stream (below)
    POST /api/hooks 204, no body, a Claude Code hook's input (below)
    POST /api/readings 204, no body, the cache proxy's limit reading (below)
    POST /api/looked 204, no body, the page records that the owner looked (below)
    POST /api/answer 204, a JSON body, the page sends the owner's choice (below)
    POST /api/check-answer 204, a JSON body, the page answers one verification prompt (below)
    anything else   404
    other methods   405 with `Allow: GET` (`Allow: POST` on `/api/hooks`, `/api/readings`,
                    `/api/looked`, `/api/answer` and `/api/check-answer`)

Two kinds of write exist. The hook and reading routes append what the proxies and hooks observe:
`POST /api/hooks` appends session observations, `POST /api/readings` the capacity kinds
`capacity.reading` and `capacity.stop` (see `capacity.py`). The hook route's checks run in this
order, each refusal closing the connection: a loopback
`Host` (else 403 as above); no `Origin` header (a browser page sends one: 403
`text/plain` `origin refused`); a `Content-Type` whose media type is
`application/json` (else 415 `json only`); a `Content-Length` that is a
non-negative integer (else 411 `length required`) of at most `MAX_HOOK_BYTES`
(else 413 `too large`, the body unread). Then the body is read, the `204` is
written and flushed, and only then is the hook ingested (`ingest_hook`): the
session that sent it never waits for the log. The hook's time is taken from the
service clock before the `204`, not when the log row is written, so a session
that updates its registry record after the answer is newer than the hook. A body that is not UTF-8 JSON
is one stderr line `console: hook_unreadable <message>`; any other failure is
`console: hook_failed <Type>: <message>`; the handler never raises. An
ignored payload (an unknown event, a missing member) appends nothing. The
route carries no token: it records observations and answers nothing (ADR-console-004).

A page write (`PAGE_WRITES`, today `POST /api/looked`, `POST /api/answer` and `POST
/api/check-answer`; ADR-console-008, ADR-console-010) is made by the desk page
alone and goes through one guard, `_page_write`, whatever its route. After the loopback `Host`
check and before any body is read, exactly one `Origin` header must equal `http://<Host>` (else
403 `text/plain` `origin refused`) and exactly one `X-Console-Token` header must equal the
install's token (else 403 `token refused`; see `write_guard.py`), each refusal closing the
connection and appending nothing. The body rule is per route. `POST /api/looked` carries no body: a
`Content-Length` other than absent or `0`, or any `Transfer-Encoding`, is 400 `no body`; it then
appends one `page.looked` event (`record_look`) and answers an empty `204`. `POST /api/answer`
carries one JSON body, and after the guard these checks run in order, each refusal `text/plain`, one
line, closing the connection, appending nothing and ticking nothing: any `Transfer-Encoding` is 411
`length required`; a `Content-Type` whose media type is not `application/json` is 415 `json only`;
a `Content-Length` that is not ASCII digits is 411 `length required`, one above `MAX_ANSWER_BYTES`
(4096) is 413 `too large` (the body unread); a body `answer.parse_request` does not accept is 400
`bad answer`. Then `answer(project_id, key, choices)` runs, and each failure writes one stderr
line before it is translated: `answer.Refused` is `console: answer_refused <project_id> <key>
<reason>` and 409 with the reason; a `ForgeError` is `console: answer_tick_failed <project_id> <key>
<code>: <detail>` (whitespace runs collapsed to one space; the detail is what `gh` wrote to stderr)
and 502 `the tracker refused the tick: <error>`; any other exception is `console: answer_failed
<Type>: <message>` and 500 `answer failed`. `POST /api/check-answer` (#863) runs the same body checks in the same order, with
`answer.parse_check_request` as the parser, and calls `answer_check(project_id, key, answer, version,
note, confirm)`; an `answer.Refused` or a `verify_answer.Refused` is the same stderr line and 409, and a
`ForgeError` and any other exception are mapped as above. Success is an empty `204`. No refusal
appends to the event log. The token is created once in
`page-token` beside the event log and reaches a client only inside `GET /`, where it replaces
the slot in the page's `console-token` meta tag.

`POST /api/readings` runs the same checks in the same order (loopback `Host`, no `Origin`,
`application/json`, a length, at most `MAX_READING_BYTES`), answers `204` and flushes, and only
then ingests (`ingest_reading`): `capacity.parse_report` keeps the whitelisted members of the body
(a body that is not UTF-8 JSON or not a report is one stderr line `console: reading_unreadable
<message>`; any other failure `console: reading_failed <Type>: <message>`; the handler never
raises). The reading's profile is the `profile` of the session the report names when the registry
placed that session under a profile, else the profile its account was last attributed to (the folded
`(account, profile)` pairs of earlier readings), else the reading is dropped with one stderr line
`console: reading_unattributed` and no identifier. No credential file is opened and no subprocess
started to learn a profile. The attributed reading is appended with its `capacity.stop` when it was
a refusal, and published. Every poll of the session registry also lists the profile directories
(`profile_dirs()`, `default_profile_dirs()`: `$HOME/.claude` and each directory of `profiles/` under
`$CLAUDE_ACCOUNTS_DIR`, else `$HOME/.claude-accounts`; only `is_dir` touches one) so a profile never
used reads `unknown` and a removed one is no longer listed, and ends by publishing, so a reset that has passed shows within one poll.

A state request reads only `view_bytes`, which is memory: no log access, no
registry read, no derivation, no file, no filesystem metadata call, no
subprocess. The view is rebuilt only by `refresh()`, which reads the fleet
registry, appends the difference to the event log and publishes the new view;
the page itself is read once, at import and given its token at construction.

The stream carries `Connection: close` and no `Content-Length`. Its first frame is
the current view (the page takes its view from the stream alone, never from a
separate `/api/state` request that could answer after a newer frame); one frame
follows each later change of the view; a `: keepalive` comment follows
`KEEPALIVE_SECONDS` without one. A frame is

    event: view\\n
    data: <the bytes of /api/state>\\n
    \\n

A write error, or the service closing, ends the stream.

The registry is read, never written. An absent registry, or one that is not a
valid registry (unreadable, not UTF-8 or JSON, or a violation of
`agent_platform.validate_registry`), is not a reading: `refresh()` appends
nothing, so a registry that vanishes or is damaged never unregisters a project.
An unreadable one, as opposed to an absent one, writes one stderr line
`console: registry_unreadable <reason>`.

Registry changes are found by a watcher thread, `WATCH_THREAD`, started by
`start()`: every `poll_seconds` it takes the registry's `(st_mtime_ns, st_size,
st_ino)` (`None` when it cannot be read) and, when that differs from the last
one, calls `refresh()` and records it once that returns. A failing `refresh()` is
one stderr line `console: refresh_failed <Type>: <message>`; the loop goes on and
the signature is not recorded, so each later poll tries again (one line per
failed poll) until a refresh succeeds. A signature is sampled before the read it vouches for, so a
registry replaced between the two differs from the recorded signature and is
read again on the next poll.
The watcher only calls `os.stat`, so an idle service does no other I/O.

Sessions arrive by hooks and by a poll of the session registry (see
`sessions.py`). A hook is appended with its `repo` mapped by `repo_of` (the main
checkout of its `cwd` by default) and its `project` column set to the registered
project whose root is that repository, so the event is the project's activity.
`SESSION_THREAD`, started by `start()`, calls `poll_sessions()` every
`session_poll_seconds` (`SESSION_POLL_SECONDS`) over the directories
`session_dirs()` names, called on every poll: `default_session_dirs()` is
`$HOME/.claude/sessions` and the `sessions` directory of every profile under
`$CLAUDE_ACCOUNTS_DIR` (else `$HOME/.claude-accounts`). `poll_sessions` holds the
ingest lock from before it reads the registry until after it publishes, so no
hook is ingested between a reading and its application and an older reading
never overwrites a newer hook. An unchanged registry appends nothing. A failing
poll is one stderr line `console: session_poll_failed <Type>: <message>` and the
loop goes on.

Tracker (#859): when the service is given a `tracker`, a thread, `TRACKER_THREAD`, started by
`start()`, calls `poll_tracker()` at once and then every `tracker_seconds` (`TRACKER_SECONDS`,
two minutes). One poll reads the tracker, through `tracker(project_id, slug, cancelled=...)`, for
each registered project that is active (`inbox.is_active`: a log event or a git write within a
day) and has a GitHub checkout (`slug_of`), one project after another and never inside the ingest
lock; a project costs at most `inbox.MAX_CALLS` calls. The stop flag is checked between projects
and, through `cancelled`, before every page, so `close()` waits for at most the one `gh` call
already running and a read cancelled or finished after the stop appends and publishes nothing.
What a read finds is appended as the four inbox events (`inbox.seen`, `inbox.changed`,
`inbox.gone`, `inbox.health`; see `view.py`) and the view is published. A failed read is one
stderr line `console: tracker_failed <project_id> <Type>: <message>`; the project's items stay,
now marked stale, and only a change of read health is appended (`inbox.health`), so a failed read
stays stale across a restart. A read that ends after its project was unregistered appends
nothing. An exception escaping a poll is one stderr line
`console: tracker_poll_failed <Type>: <message>` and the loop goes on. Without a tracker no
thread starts and nothing is read.

Answers (#862, ADR-console-010): `answer(project_id, key, choices)` ticks one option under each
question of a decision item on the tracker, through `tick` (default `answer.tick_on_tracker`;
`tick(slug, issue, comment_id, questions, choices)`), and marks the item answered at once. It
raises `answer.Refused` with `NOT_OPEN` when the project is not registered, no record
`(project_id, key)` exists, or the item is answered, is not a decision, or has no questions; with
`CHOOSE` unless `choices` is a list of one `int` (not `bool`) per question within its options; with
`SENDING` while another answer to the same item runs. A `ForgeError` of the tick propagates. The
tick runs outside the ingest lock, so a hook or a poll never waits for `gh`. On success, under the
lock, when the record still exists, is unanswered and holds the same `(question, options)`, one
`inbox.changed` event with the item answered (its `chosen` set) is appended and published, so the
count leaves the headline at once; otherwise, and once the service is stopping, nothing is appended.
On failure nothing is appended. The appended item is what the reader makes of the ticked comment, so
the next read appends nothing. A tracker read that began before an answer finished never turns that
item back to unanswered (each answer takes a generation; a read keeps the answered item when its
own generation is older), and a read that began after it is authoritative.

Verification answers (#863): `answer_check(project_id, key, answer, version, note, confirm)` answers one runner
prompt of the inbox (a manual check, a verdict, an approval or a stale check) through `owner_path`
(default `verify_answer.answer_prompt`; `owner_path(slug, issue, comment_id, answer, version=version,
note=note, paid=paid)`, where `version` is the one the page sent, so the owner path refuses a prompt that
changed since the owner read it), which runs outside the ingest lock. Under the lock, in order, it raises `answer.Refused`
with `NOT_OPEN` when the project is not registered, no record exists, the item is answered or the
item takes no answer; with `NOT_AN_ANSWER` when the word is not among the item's answers; with
`CONFIRM` when the word is `approve` and `confirm` is not exactly the item's own `confirm` text (an
item without one is never approved): every live or paid approval needs its typed confirmation; with
`SENDING` while another answer to the same item runs. No request answers more than one item, and no
multi-item route exists. A note posts the owner's text and leaves the item open; any other word marks
the item answered at once, as `answer` does and with the same generation bookkeeping, when the record
still exists, is unanswered and names the same comment. A failure of `owner_path` propagates and
appends nothing.

Retention (ADR-console-009): construction runs one retention pass (`EventLog.retain`) after
opening the log and before reading its events, and `RETENTION_THREAD`, started by `start()`, calls
`retain()` every `retention_seconds` (`RETENTION_SECONDS`, one day). A pass that removed rows
re-folds the sessions and the inbox records and re-derives the last look and the moments from the
log under the ingest lock, with the construction code, and publishes, so the running digest equals
the one a restart would publish, and a later change is judged against what the log still holds. A failing pass
is one stderr line `console: retention_failed <Type>: <message>` and the loop goes on.

Digest: the view carries `digest.digest(moments, last look, now)` (see `digest.py`). The last look
is the newest `page.looked` event of the log, the same for every client and across restarts; the
moments are folded from each appended batch against the state before it, and only those after the
current window start are kept. The window of a first visit moves with the clock, so
`DIGEST_THREAD`, started by `start()`, calls `expire_digest()` every `digest_seconds`
(`DIGEST_SECONDS`): it trims the moments to the window and publishes, which changes the view only
when a moment left. A failure is one stderr line `console: digest_expiry_failed <Type>: <message>`
and the loop goes on.

Deliveries (#858): after each `poll_sessions()` the same thread calls `poll_deliveries()`, which
reads the run journals (see `deliveries.py`) of every folded session that is not ended and has a
repository, under the `projects` directory beside each of `session_dirs()`, outside the ingest
lock, and then appends `delivery.seen` and `delivery.gone` rows and publishes under it (every
poll publishes, so the minutes since a run moved advance; an unchanged view bumps no version). A
journal is read incrementally; one that was truncated or replaced is folded again from its start.
A run leaves only when its final record exists or its journal is confirmed absent (its listing
succeeded without it); a journal or a listing that cannot be read keeps the run's last
observation. A run that names no issue is not listed. A branch names its issue through the
project's configured branch pattern, `branch_pattern_of(repo)` (default
`deliveries.configured_branch_pattern`, kept once resolved); while it is None no run of that
repository names an issue, and a run read under another pattern is folded again from its start.
A state request reads memory only. Stderr lines: `console: delivery_poll_failed <Type>: <message>`
(a poll that raised, once per failed poll), `console: branch_pattern_unresolved <repo>` (a
repository's pattern did not resolve, again only after it resolved in between), `console: journal_unreadable <path> <reason>` (a journal or its final record turned
unreadable, again only after it read successfully in between) and `console: journals_unreadable
<session_id> <reason>` (a session's journal listing turned unreadable, likewise).

Construction order: bind the server (an `OSError` propagates and nothing else is
opened); load or create the page token (a `write_guard.TokenError` propagates: the service does
not start); open the event log; run one retention pass; fold the projects, the sessions, the inbox,
the read health and the deliveries, then the last look and the digest moments, from it; publish
the view; sample the registry's signature; `refresh()`; `poll_sessions()`; `poll_deliveries()`. The
absent set starts empty, so a restart drops a session only after two polls miss
it. On any failure after the bind, what was opened is closed and the exception
re-raised. `start()` serves on a daemon thread named `console-http`; `close()`
sets the stop flag, then `closing`, wakes every waiter, joins the watcher, the session poll, the
tracker, retention and digest threads and tears the rest down; it is idempotent.
