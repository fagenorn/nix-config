# eleven-m5 inference settings

`omlx.nix` owns model aliases/defaults, selected performance settings, and the
patches required by the Homebrew oMLX installation. `omlx-configure` is generated
as a user command and called by system activation. It checks every patch before
applying any, recursively merges owned settings, preserves unrelated UI settings
and server secrets, and records `.omlx/.restart-needed` after changes. Incompatible
patches fail activation. Activation clears the marker only after a successful
server restart. Applying the user command alone does not restart active work.

The Anthropic patch accepts Claude Code's `output_config.effort` and preserves
valid explicit `chat_template_kwargs.reasoning_effort`. Qwen4-exp templates
receive low→low, medium→medium, and unsupported high/max→xhigh. An advertised
high alias remains valid. Other model families receive their original tier.
Unknown API effort strings and invalid
effective Qwen template overrides fail explicitly. Omitted or null effort uses
the model setting. Forced model keys retain precedence, as do Anthropic thinking
controls over unforced enable_thinking values.

Both served Qwen3.8 variants default to medium effort and a 4096-token thinking
budget. This bounds routine reasoning while preserving an explicit request's
`thinking.budget_tokens` override. Disabled thinking stays disabled even when the
default budget is attached to generation parameters. GLM's reasoning settings
are not changed. A budget is a reasoning-token bound, not a latency guarantee.

Run `nix build --no-link .#checks.aarch64-darwin.omlx-adapter` for the portable
adapter/configuration tests, then `just build eleven-m5` for the host. CI builds
the corresponding x86_64-linux check as part of the required Nix Eval job. The
check uses the pinned oMLX flake input and immutable real Qwen template, parsing
the real schema and executing the real Anthropic endpoint to engine preflight.
GPU inference is covered separately by deployed Claude-shaped smoke requests.

After a Homebrew update, incompatible patches require checking upstream before
regenerating or removing them. The GLM fix tracks upstream PR4644; the effort
patch is the local compatibility change for nix-config issue410.
